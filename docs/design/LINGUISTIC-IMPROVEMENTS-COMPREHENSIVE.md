# Comprehensive Linguistic Improvements for Structs MCP

**Date**: January 2025  
**Status**: 📝 Suggestions (No Changes Made Yet)  
**Scope**: All tool definitions across the structs-mcp project

---

## Overview

This document provides linguistic improvements for all tool interfaces in the structs-mcp project, making them more human-friendly and easier for AI agents to understand and use correctly.

---

## Common Patterns to Fix

### 1. **Implementation Details in Descriptions**
- ❌ "from consensus API"
- ❌ "from database"
- ❌ "using signer.tx_* functions"
- ❌ "database handles signing"
- ❌ "requires DATABASE_URL"

### 2. **Technical Jargon Without Context**
- ❌ "operate_ambit" (what is an ambit?)
- ❌ "struct_type_id" (what types are available?)
- ❌ "consensus API" (what is this?)
- ❌ "pagination key" (what does this mean?)

### 3. **Tool Name References**
- ❌ "returned by structs_workflow_execute"
- ❌ "started by structs_calculate_proof_of_work"

### 4. **Conditional/Contextual Descriptions**
- ❌ "Entity ID (struct ID for building/mining/refining, fleet ID for raids)"
- ❌ Parameters that vary by action type without clear explanation

### 5. **Unclear Action Names**
- ❌ "struct_build_initiate" vs "struct_build_complete"
- ❌ Technical message names instead of user-friendly actions

---

## Improvements by Tool Category

### Query Tools

#### List Tools (Generated by Factory)

**Current**:
```
"List all players from consensus API with optional pagination"
```

**Suggested**:
```
"Get a list of all players. You can request more results using pagination."
```

## Summary of Principles

1. **Remove Implementation Details**: No mentions of "consensus API", "database", "signer.tx_*", internal function names
2. **Use Natural Language**: "Get information" vs "Query state", "Check if" vs "Validate"
3. **Explain Technical Terms**: Define "ambit", "slot", "struct_type_id" in context
4. **Focus on User Intent**: What does the user want to accomplish?
5. **Provide Context**: Why would you use this? When is it optional?
6. **Avoid Tool Name References**: Don't reference other tools by name in descriptions
7. **Add Examples**: Show what values look like, what they mean
8. **Explain Benefits**: Why would you use this tool? What problem does it solve?
9. **Use Conversational Tone**: "You", "your", "I'll" where appropriate
10. **Clarify Conditional Logic**: When parameters vary by action, explain clearly

---

## Implementation Notes

- Most improvements are **linguistic only** - no code changes required
- Some improvements (like renaming action types) would require code changes
- Can be implemented incrementally by tool category
- Test with AI agents to verify improved prompt understanding
- Consider creating a style guide for future tool definitions
